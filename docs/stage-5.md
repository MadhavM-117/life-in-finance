Here is what stage 5 looks like: 

Month 4 – First Credit Card Offer
“Your bank offers you a shiny new credit card with a ₹50,000 limit. You’re tempted to use it for shopping.”
Decision 4: Do you sign up and use it?
A. Yes, buy a new phone (₹25,000 EMI, 12 months, 14% interest)
B. No, continue managing with savings


Outcome by Month 12:
If A: Monthly EMI of ~₹2,300 reduces savings, total cost ends up at ~₹27,500
If B: No extra expense


Groww Tip: Credit cards help build credit history but must be used responsibly.
