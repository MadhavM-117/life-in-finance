Here is what stage 8 looks like:

Month 10 – Emergency Expense
“Your bike breaks down. You need ₹10,000 for repairs.”
Decision 7: How do you arrange it?
A. Withdraw from Bank Savings
B. Redeem Mutual Fund units (1% exit load)
C. Use Credit Card


Outcome:
A: No penalty, but savings drop
B: Exit load reduces MF redemption value (₹10,000 → ₹9,900)
C: Immediate fix, but repayment with interest later
